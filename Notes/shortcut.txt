Slack:

add `code` to make code highlighted

Bold: Surround the text with asterisks *like this* to make it bold.

Italic: Surround the text with underscores _like this_ to make it italic.

Strikethrough: Surround the text with tildes ~like this~ to add strikethrough.

Code: Surround the text with backticks `like this` to format it as code. You can also use triple backticks to format multiple lines of code.

Quote: Start the line with > to format it as a quote. You can also use >>> to format multiple lines of text as a quote.

Mentioning users and channels: Use the @ symbol followed by the username or channel name to mention them. For example, @john or #general.

Emoji: Use colons :smile: to insert an emoji into your message.

Linking: Surround the link with angle brackets <http://example.com> to display it as a clickable link.

Unfurling: Slack automatically unfurls links and displays a preview of the content. To disable unfurling, surround the link with < >.

Escaping special characters: If you want to display special characters as they are without formatting, you can use a backslash \ before the character. For example, \* will display as an asterisk rather than formatting the text as bold.
