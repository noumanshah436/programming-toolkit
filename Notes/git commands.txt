Note:
If the files are already staged and we now want to ignore them, we also need to clean cache otherwise they will not be ignored.

1) Added in gitignore file:

2) Run this command to remove the files from Git's cache so they can be ignored moving forward.
git rm --cached media/profile_pics/*

git clean -fd
git reset --hard

**************************************************

// suppose you commit changes and push it to github and
// now you want to delete last commit from github
// (this will revert changes both from local and github)

git reset HEAD^ --hard
git push -f

Undo commit but changes remains there.
( git uncheck last commit ):

git reset --soft HEAD~1

for last n commits commit:
git reset --soft HEAD~n


then force push to github

**************************************************

git checkout index.html    ---  recover this file
git checkout -f            --- match all files to previous commit

git revert <commit-id>       # Undo a commit by creating a new commit


**************************************************

stage files and run this to stash them ( make diff only for staged files):

git diff --cached > 'saving_work.patch'

******************************

https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/git-stash-commands/#how-to-stash-your-changes-

stash:
The git stash command takes your uncommitted changes (both staged and unstaged), saves them away for later use, and then reverts them from your working copy

1) git stash save "old_work_all_backup"

2) git stash list

3) git stash apply stash@{0}


******************************************************************************

Stage part of file to commit:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1085162/commit-only-part-of-a-files-changes-in-git

**************

To Remove the file from the Staging Area, making sure that it will NOT be part of the next commit.

git restore --staged myFile.js

************

In case you also want to discard the local changes in this file, you can simply remove the --staged option:
This will discard any local modifications in this file and reset it to its last committed state

$ git restore index.html

****************************************

git reset to Unstage:

Apart from restore you can also use git reset to unstage changes. If you're using a Git version older than 2.23, you will have to use reset because restore is quite a new feature in Git.
Exactly like git restore --staged, this makes sure the file is NOT included in our next commit. The local changes themselves are not affected by this command.

$ git reset myFile.js

********

Unstaging All Files at Once
Sometimes, you might want to unstage all of the files you had already added to the Staging Area. In such a situation, you can use git reset without further options:

$ git reset

The Staging Area will be emptied (but your local changes themselves are left untouched).


******************************************************************************

git log     -- show all commits

git log -p     --  show all added or removed lines of code

git log -p -1    ----> :q

git log -p <file>      ---- show all changes for a specific file

git log --pretty=oneline   ----  show all commits in one line

git log --pretty=short   ----  show all commits in with just author name and message

pres q to quit from log

**********

git diff            --  compare working tree with the staging area
git dif --staged    --  compare  staging area with last commit

git diff --color             # show colored diff


git diff --cached    -- command is used to view the changes that have been staged (added to the index) but not yet committed in Git.
                        It shows the differences between the currently staged changes and the last commit.


Note:
In Git, the commands git diff --staged and git diff --cached are equivalent and provide the same functionality.
Both commands display the differences between the changes that have been staged (added to the index) and the last commit.

The reason for having two different command options (--staged and --cached) that perform the same operation is historical. Originally, the command was git diff --cached,
but the term "staged" is more intuitive for users, so the --staged option was introduced as an alternative to --cached. Both options can be used interchangeably.

**************************************************

git rm file.txt   		        # removes file.txt both from git and file system
git rm --cached file.txt 		# only removes file.txt both from git index
git rm --cached waste.html      ---  add file to untracked area

git branch feature1    -- make new branch

git checkout feature1      --  switch to this branch

git checkout master

git checkout -b feature2       -- make branch and also switch to it

****

Delete a branch with:

git branch -d <branch>

The -d option will delete the branch only if it has already been pushed and merged with the remote branch.

Use -D instead if you want to force the branch to be deleted, even if it hasn't been pushed or merged yet. The branch is now deleted locally.

git branch -D feature1

https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/git-stash-commands/#how-to-stash-your-changes-


-> The git stash command takes your uncommitted changes (both staged and unstaged), saves them away for later use, and then reverts them from your working copy

git stash


-> To provide a bit more context, it's good practice to annotate your stashes with a description, using

git stash save "message"


*******************************

Stashing untracked or ignored files

By default, running git stash will stash:
-> changes that have been added to your index (staged changes)
-> changes made to files that are currently tracked by Git (unstaged changes)

But it will not stash:
-> new files in your working copy that have not yet been staged
-> files that have been ignored


Adding the -u option (or --include-untracked) tells git stash to also stash your untracked files:
git stash -u


You can include changes to ignored files as well by passing the -a option (or --all) when running git stash.


*******************************

git stash pop           			--  for latest stash
git stash pop stash@{2}			-- for particular stash

Apply the stash and also remove that stash from the stash stack.

*******************************

git stash apply				--  for latest stash
git stash apply stash@{2}			-- for particular stash

Apply the stash and keep them in your stash in the stash stack


*******************************

-> You can view a summary of a stash with :

git stash show

-> Or pass the -p option (or --patch) to view the full diff of a stash:

git stash show -p

*******************************

Cleaning up your stash:

-> If you decide you no longer need a particular stash, you can delete it with git stash drop:

 git stash drop stash@{1}

-> Or you can delete all of your stashes with:

$ git stash clear

*******************************

make diff of stashed work:

git stash show -p stash@{n} > my-patch-file.patch

https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-better-git-commit-messages/

Conventional Commits syntax:

<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]

**************************************

The commit type can include the following:

feat – a new feature is introduced with the changes
fix – a bug fix has occurred
chore – changes that do not relate to a fix or feature and don't modify src or test files (for example updating dependencies)
refactor – refactored code that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
docs – updates to documentation such as a the README or other markdown files
style – changes that do not affect the meaning of the code, likely related to code formatting such as white-space, missing semi-colons, and so on.
test – including new or correcting previous tests
perf – performance improvements
ci – continuous integration related
build – changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
revert – reverts a previous commit

**************************************

Full Conventional Commit Example
fix: fix foo to enable bar

This fixes the broken behavior of the component by doing xyz.

BREAKING CHANGE
Before this fix foo wasn't enabled at all, behavior changes from <old> to <new>

Closes D2IQ-12345

empty commit messages

**************************************


Here's a great template of a good commit message originally written by Tim pope:

Capitalized, short (50 chars or less) summary

More detailed explanatory text, if necessary.  Wrap it to about 72
characters or so.  In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
subject of an email and the rest of the text as the body.  The blank
line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit
the body entirely); tools like rebase can get confused if you run the
two together.

Write your commit message in the imperative: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed bug"
or "Fixes bug."  This convention matches up with commit messages generated
by commands like git merge and git revert.

Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

- Bullet points are okay, too

- Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, followed by a
  single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions vary here

- Use a hanging indent

If you use an issue tracker, add a reference(s) to them at the bottom,
like so:

Resolves: #123


********************************************************************************************************
cherry-pick:

In Git, "cherry picking" is a technique used to select and apply specific commits from one branch to another.
 This allows you to pick individual changes (commits) and apply them to a different branch without merging the entire branch.
 Cherry picking is useful in situations where you only want specific changes from one branch and not the entire set of changes.

Here's an example of how to use cherry pick in Git:

Let's say you have two branches: `feature_branch` and `main_branch`. You want to pick a specific commit from `feature_branch` and apply it to `main_branch`.


3. **Identify the Commit to Cherry Pick:**
   Use `git log` to find the commit hash of the change you want to cherry pick. Suppose the commit hash is `abcdef`:
   ```bash
   git checkout feature_branch
   git log
   ```

2. **Check out the Target Branch:**
   Now move to the branch where you want to apply the cherry-picked commit. In this case, it's the `main_branch`:
   ```bash
   git checkout main_branch
   ```

3. **Cherry Pick the Commit:**
   Apply the commit to the current branch using `git cherry-pick`:
   ```bash
   git cherry-pick abcdef
   ```

   Replace `abcdef` with the actual commit hash you want to cherry-pick.

4. **Resolve Conflicts (if any):**
   If there are conflicts during the cherry-pick process, Git will pause and ask you to resolve them. Manually resolve conflicts, then continue the cherry-pick process:
   ```bash
   git add <conflicted_file>
   git cherry-pick --continue
   ```

5. **Commit Changes (if conflicts were resolved):**
   If you had conflicts, you'll need to make a new commit after resolving them:
   ```bash
   git commit
   ```

6. **Finish the Cherry Pick:**
   If there were no conflicts or after resolving conflicts and committing the changes, the cherry-pick process is complete.

7. **Optional: Push Changes to Remote:**
   If you want to push the changes to the remote repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin main_branch
   ```

This example demonstrates cherry picking a specific commit (`abcdef`) from one branch (`feature_branch`) and applying it to another branch (`main_branch`).
Remember that cherry-picking individual commits should be done with caution, especially in a collaborative environment, to avoid potential conflicts and ensure the integrity of the codebase.

When you use `git diff` with two branches, it compares the changes between them. The order of the branches in the command affects what you see.

### `git diff main..feature`

- **What it shows**: Changes that are in the `feature` branch but not in the `main` branch.
- **Use this when**: You want to see what has been added to the `feature` branch that isn't in `main`.

Think of it like this: You're standing on the `main` branch and looking over to the `feature` branch to see what new things have been added over there.

### `git diff feature..main`

- **What it shows**: Changes that are in the `main` branch but not in the `feature` branch.
- **Use this when**: You want to see what has been added to the `main` branch that isn't in `feature`.

Here, imagine you're standing on the `feature` branch and looking over to the `main` branch to see what new things have been added there.

### Practical Examples:

1. **You are working on a `feature` branch and want to check what new changes have been made to `main` since you branched off:**
   ```sh
   git diff feature..main
   ```

2. **You are on the `main` branch and want to see what changes would be introduced if you merged `feature` into `main`:**
   ```sh
   git diff main..feature
   ```

### Key Idea:

- The first branch in `git diff A..B` is where you start (your reference point).
- The second branch is what you’re comparing against (what changes have been made since you branched off).

So, `git diff main..feature` shows what’s new in `feature`, and `git diff feature..main` shows what’s new in `main`.

I hope this simplifies it for you! Let me know if you have any questions.
